# Lilypond Marching Percussion Tools

This is custom drum staves that provide custom noteheads and some other
convienences when typing marching percussion music in Lilypond. The most notable
features are:
-   drum staves - snare taps are `sn` or `snare`, rim shots are `rimshot` or
    `rs`, etc.
-   sticking format
	-   enter sticking mode with `\stickingFormatOn` and
    exit with `\stickingFormatOff`
	-   to annotate a snare tap as right-handed quater note, you'd enter
	    `sn4_\rh`
-   overall format that's better suited for reading music down - entered with
    `\format`
